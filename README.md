# Dorico.Net
A library for working with Dorico's Remote Control API

# Description

The Dorico API is currently not well documented.  It doesn't provide much functionality beyond what is possible via the application menus.

See Example app for usage.

This code has been tested with Dorico Pro 5 on Windows 11.

Leave feedback or open a branch if there's a common functionality you think should be added.
